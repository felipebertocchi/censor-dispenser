# censor-dispenser
This is the solution I came up with when I applied to the Censor Dispenser Project on Codecademy.

https://www.codecademy.com/practice/projects/censor-dispenser

I’m pretty satisfied with my code as it can handle both upper and lowercase letters, as well as word length and punctuation! I’ve had a hard time looking for a way to handle word case as the .replace() method is case sensitive, but then I found a way to fix this using Regular Expression or Regex. (To be frank I still have a lot to learn about it’s syntax). Anyway, I left the links to forums I used to get around it in my code. Feel free to comment any ways to make this code better!

# Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

# Project Goals
You’ve recently gotten a job working in the IT department at one of Silicon Valley’s hottest new startups, AirWeb. The company is developing a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence engine designed to help provide a new perspective on the world’s problems. Interestingly, very few people know the details of AirWeb ‘s work and the company is very secretive about its technology, even to its own investors.

You report directly to the Head of Product, a person named Mr. Cloudy, and he has a very important task for you. You see, every month, the head researchers down in the lab send an email to the board of investors to tell them about the status of the project. Cloudy wants you to intercept these emails and censor any “proprietary information” included in them.
