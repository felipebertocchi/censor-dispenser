# censor-dispenser
This is the solution I came up with when I applied to the Censor Dispenser Project on Codecademy.

I’m pretty satisfied with my code as it can handle both upper and lowercase letters, as well as word length and punctuation! I’ve had a hard time looking for a way to handle word case as the .replace() method is case sensitive, but then I found a way to fix this using Regular Expression or Regex. (To be frank I still have a lot to learn about it’s syntax). Anyway, I left the links to forums I used to get around it in my code. Feel free to comment any ways to make this code better!
